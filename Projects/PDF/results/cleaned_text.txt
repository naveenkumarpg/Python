What is Lorem Ipsum? 
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
industry s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of 
Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like 
Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. 
Why do we use it? 
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking 
at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more or less normal distribution of letters, as 
opposed to using Content here, content here , making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing 
packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for lorem 
ipsum will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, 
sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose injected humour and the like . 
 
 
Where does it come from? 
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden 
Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum 
passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum The Extremes 
of Good and Evil by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular 
during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.. , comes from a line in 
section 1.10.32. 
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 
1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact 
original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. 
Where can I get some? 
There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration 
in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don t look even slightly believable. If you are 
going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn t anything embarrassing hidden in the 
middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as 
necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, 
combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. 
The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non characteristic 
words etc.

The standard Lorem Ipsum passage, used since the 1500s 
 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et 
dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex 
ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat 
nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim 
id est laborum. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1914 translation by H. Rackham 
 But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born 
and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer 
of the truth, the master builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, 
because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter 
consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to 
obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain 
 can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious 
physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man 
who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that 
produces no resultant pleasure?
